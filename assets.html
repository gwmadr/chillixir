

1.  **Create a folder** named `images` inside your `assets` folder.
    - Your structure would look like:
        ```
        MASTER-TEMPLATE/
        ├── index.html
        ├── about.html
        ├── projects.html
        ├── contact.html
        ├── styles.css
        └── assets/
            └── images/
                ├── logo.png
                ├── product-spray.jpg
                ├── product-cream.jpg
                └── product-incense.jpg
        ```

2.  **Reference images in your HTML** using the correct path:
    ```html
    <!-- Example in your index.html -->
    <img src="assets/images/product-spray.jpg" alt="Chillixir Magnesium Spray">





In web development, an **`assets`** folder is a standard directory (folder) where you store all the **static files** that your website needs to display properly, like:

- **Images** (.jpg, .png, .svg)
- **Icons**
- **Fonts**
- **PDFs** (for resumes/downloads)
- **Videos**

In your original GitHub code, you had a folder literally named `assets` that contained your images (like `headshot.jpg`). That's what I was referring to!

### **For Your Chillixir Site:**

Yes! You will need an **`assets`** or **`images`** folder for your product pictures, logo, and any other visuals.

**Above ^ is how to set it up cleanly in your Master Template:** ^

    ```

This keeps everything incredibly organized, especially when you start having lots of images for different clients.

You are thinking like a pro! Setting up a logical file structure from the beginning saves so much headache later.
