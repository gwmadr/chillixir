            <h1>We don't just sell products, we build community</h1>
            <p>Chillixir was born from a personal need: finding calm amidst chaos. As an LGBTQIA+ refugee, I've experienced firsthand how stress and anxiety build up in the body. Seeking relief, I discovered the power of magnesium and lavender, but only found generic options, full of chemicals and without soul.</p>
          <!--   <img src="assets/about-placeholder.jpg" alt="A photo of [Your Name]" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 2rem 0;"> -->
            <p>I decided we deserved something better. Something natural, effective, and made with intention. So I created it myself.</p>

<p>Today, every bottle of Chillixir is handmade in Mexico with 100% natural ingredients, cruelty-free, and in glass containers to reduce plastic. But this goes beyond ingredients: it's a commitment to holistic wellness, inclusion, and sustainability.</p>
<p>Choosing Chillixir isn't just buying a spray or cream. It's supporting a dream driven by resilience and the belief that we all deserve deep, accessible peace.</p>
